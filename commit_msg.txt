Initialized git

Project wasn't previously tracked so there has been a lot added and removed.
Current codebase features:
- Meal, User, and Ingredient endpoints, models, services, and bespoke exceptions
- Redis server disabled for technical reasons in dev environment
- A static html for same-origin testing
- Constants for mapping nutrients to ensure data consistency
etc
